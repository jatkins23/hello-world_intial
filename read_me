In this problem we ask you list problems you could solve with a working version
of fgroups. Be imaginative. For one set of ideas, look up the man page for find,
especially the -exec option. And it might help you to know that in the arcane
jargon of computer science, a fingerprint is sometimes called a "message
digest". This information is especially useful if you also know how to use the
apropos command.

Please include your answer to part C in your README file

Find: searches directory tree 

              Matches files which are executable and directories which are
searchable (in a file name  resolution  sense).   This  takes  into
accountaccess control lists and other permissions artefacts which the -perm test
ignores. This test makes use of the access(2) system call, and so can be fooled
by NFS servers which do UID mapping (or root-squashing), since many systems
implement access(2) in the  clientâ€™s kerneland so cannot make use of the UID
mapping information held on the server. Because this test is based only on the
result of the access(2) system call, there is no guarantee that a file for which
this test succeeds can actually be executed.
