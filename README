Ideas

Possible implementations

1) Blood Type Matches.
	Fingerprint Groups would be very helpful in grouping potential donors
and recipients of organs or blood in small communities as patients are split
into distinct categories based upon blood type and need to be matched up. This
would allow it to be easily seen whether there are potential partners so that
donations could be quickly and easily facilitated. The program would not display
blood type groups that had only one member, which is fine because then matchups
would be impossible.

2) Noah's Ark
	Imagine a Noah's Ark level flood scenario in which it is possible to
document every animal that is still alive. It would only be useful to fill some
of the precious space on the ark if there were only one of a given species and
it would be unable to reproduce. Thus, using species as fingerprints, it would
be quick and easy to find whatever possible pairs/groups it would be possible to
save that would be able to repopulate the post-flood world with its species
while letting all of the singletons die out without wasting valuable ark-space.
